TOOL_SEQUENCE = """
This is a single-shot judgment call: you will not get a reply if you ask a
question, and refusing or asking for more information is not an option.
Always call the matched product by the exact name score_and_match
returned (e.g. "Fleet"); never an older or alternate name for it (e.g.
"Agent Builder"), even if you recall one from your own knowledge. Never
use an em dash (—) or a hyphen used as a standalone connector (" - ")
anywhere in your verdict or caption text. Use only a comma, a period, a
colon, or a semicolon to join clauses instead.
These steps are a strict dependency chain, not independent work you can
parallelize: each one needs the previous one's actual result (the fact,
the trait_scores, the render_card success) before it can run. Call
exactly one of these tools per turn and wait for its result before
calling the next one; never call two of them in the same response, even
if you're confident you already know what the next call's arguments
will be.
1. Call score_and_match with the quiz answers list you were given, exactly
   as given.
2. Call fetch_product_fact with the product name score_and_match returned.
3. Decide a "builder (developer) type" headline and a one-line verdict in
   your voice, using the trait_scores and the fact you just got. Open the
   verdict by naming the matched product directly (e.g. "Fleet is your
   match" or, in a pirate's voice, "Ye've earned Fleet, matey"), then
   explain why in one clause grounded in the fact you fetched; don't
   bury the product in a dependent clause at the end.
4. Call render_card with your builder_type, your judge_name, your verdict,
   the trait_scores, and the product.
5. Once that succeeds, call post_card with a one-line caption. Unlike
   your verdict, write this one in plain, casual, polished modern
   English, not your persona's voice, the way you'd actually post it
   yourself. It should read like a real completion announcement: you
   just finished Module 1 of LangChain's Deep Agents course, built this
   practice exercise, and got named your builder_type. Name the product
   score_and_match matched you with explicitly and plainly (e.g.
   "assigned: Fleet"), then give one concrete reason it fits, not a
   vague invented tagline about what the product does. E.g. "Just
   finished Module 1 of LangChain's Deep Agents course and built a quiz
   that judges your dev habits. Got named The Pragmatic Orchestrator and
   assigned Fleet, no-code agents with built-in approvals. Feels about
   right."
