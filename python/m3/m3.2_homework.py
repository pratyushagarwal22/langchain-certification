"""M3.2 Homework: Bundle a Reference File Into Your Skill.

THE IDEA
The lab's two skills (qualify-lead and draft-pitch) are each a single flat
SKILL.md file with everything inline. But the lesson also covered a third
stage of progressive disclosure: a skill can point to supporting files (a
reference doc, a template, a script) that live alongside SKILL.md and that
the agent only reads when it actually needs them, instead of stuffing
everything into the system prompt up front. This homework asks you to write
a skill for a topic or workflow YOU pick (not sales) that bundles a SECOND
file with details the agent needs but that aren't in SKILL.md itself, then
confirm from the trace that the agent actually called `read_file` on that
second file before answering, rather than guessing.

WHAT YOU FILL IN
  TODO 1: write your own SKILL.md content. It must instruct the agent to
    read a `reference.md` file (in the same skill directory) for specific
    details it needs, and must NOT restate those details inline. The `name`
    field in your frontmatter must exactly match SKILL_NAME below.
  TODO 2: write reference.md's content: the specific facts, numbers, or
    template your skill's instructions point to and depend on.
  TODO 3: write a system prompt and a user question that should activate
    your skill.

# TODO 1: Write your own SKILL.md content.
#
# Requirements:
#   - YAML frontmatter with `name` (must equal SKILL_NAME above) and
#     `description` (a specific sentence describing WHEN to use this skill).
#   - Steps that tell the agent to open `reference.md` (in this same skill
#     directory) for the specific details it needs to do the task well.
#   - Do NOT put those details in SKILL.md itself; if the agent could do
#     the task correctly without ever reading reference.md, this doesn't
#     exercise progressive disclosure.
#
# Example shape (delete this and write your own):
#   return """---
#   name: your-skill-name
#   description: Use when the user wants to ...
#   ---
#
#   # Your Skill Title
#
#   **Step 1: ...**: ...
#   **Step 2: ...**: before proceeding, read reference.md in this skill's
#     directory for the exact ... to use. Do not guess these.
