"""Run the manuscript agent, then self-check its findings against the known
seeded corruptions in data/epic_corpus_key.json, an immediate, exact way to
see whether the workflow's book-by-book dispatch actually covered everything.

This check is for your own feedback while working through the lab, not a
submitted grade: the key ships openly alongside the corpus.
