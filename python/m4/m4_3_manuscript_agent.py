"""Module 4 · Lesson 3: Dynamic subagents, "The Corrupted Manuscript" lab.

A handful of anachronistic sentences have been spliced into a combined,
public-domain corpus of the Iliad, Odyssey, and Aeneid (data/epic_corpus.txt;
see data/prepare_corpus.py for how it was built). The corpus is far too
large for one context window, so the main agent is given the interpreter and
a `book-scanner` subagent: it writes a workflow that reads the manuscript,
splits it on the normalized "=== EPIC BOOK N ===" headers, and dispatches one
scanner call per book, collecting whatever each one flags.

The corpus never enters the model's own context. Only `book-scanner`'s short,
distilled findings do: the interpreter holds the 2MB file, the model never
sees more than one book's worth of text (inside a subagent call) at a time.
