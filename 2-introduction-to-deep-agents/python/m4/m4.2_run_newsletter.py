"""Run the editor agent and save everything it produces.

Note on file handling: Deep Agents *can* be given real local disk access (via a
FilesystemBackend), but we deliberately don't. This agent runs on the default
StateBackend, so its writes land in agent state, not on your machine. Letting an
agent write to your filesystem is a permission you grant — and shouldn't, when
the agent is acting on untrusted web-search content. Instead, this trusted host
code reads the files out of agent state (the "files" channel) after invoke and
mirrors them to OUT_DIR: the finished newsletter plus each researcher's raw
/research/<genre>/ archive, so you can inspect what was quarantined there.
