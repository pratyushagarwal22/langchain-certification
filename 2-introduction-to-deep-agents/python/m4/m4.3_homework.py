"""M4.3 Homework: Write Your Own Dynamic Subagent Workflow.

THE IDEA
The lab gave the main agent a 2MB manuscript split into labeled books and
had it write a "workflow" that dispatched one book-scanner subagent per
book, so the full corpus never entered the main model's own context. This
homework asks you to do the same shape of thing on a scenario of your own
choosing: a synthetic corpus of your own, split into your own labeled
sections, and a subagent that scans each section for something other than
anachronisms.

A few starting points, if you want one:
  - A Sherlock Holmes story, split by chapter, scanned for clues the
    detective mentions but never actually explains.
  - The script of Bee Movie or Shrek, split by scene, scanned for lines
    that don't match the character who supposedly says them.
  - Your own corrupted classic, like the lab's, but seeded with a
    different kind of error: wrong units, swapped character names,
    continuity errors between chapters.

WHAT YOU FILL IN
  TODO 1: write your own corpus, a single string split into at least 5
    labeled sections using a consistent header format (like the lab's
    "=== EPIC BOOK N ===").
  TODO 2: write the section-scanner's system prompt (what should it flag in
    one section?) and the main agent's system prompt (telling it to run a
    workflow that splits your corpus and dispatches one scanner call per
    section).

RUN
  cd python
  uv run ./m4/m4.3_homework.py

NOTE
  This uses the code interpreter (langchain_quickjs), same as the lab. Make
  sure you've run `uv sync` from python/ so it's installed.

# TODO 1: Write your own corpus.
#
# Requirements:
#   - A single string with at least 5 labeled sections.
#   - Pick a consistent header format, e.g. "=== SECTION N ===" or
#     "=== TICKET N ===", and stick to it exactly: the main agent's prompt
#     (TODO 2) needs to describe the same format so it can split on it.
#   - Plant something worth finding in a few of the sections (an off-topic
#     sentence, a specific keyword, whatever your scanner in TODO 2 is
#     looking for) so there's something for the workflow to actually
#     surface.
#
# Example shape (delete this and write your own):
#   return """\
#   === SECTION 1 ===
#   ...
#
#   === SECTION 2 ===
#   ...

#   - main_prompt: tells the main agent about the corpus file, the header
#     format from TODO 1, and to run a WORKFLOW that splits the corpus and
#     dispatches one scanner call per section (the word "workflow" is what
#     triggers code-based dispatch, see the lesson).
